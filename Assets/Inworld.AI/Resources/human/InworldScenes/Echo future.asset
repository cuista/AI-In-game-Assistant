  description: 'The game world is set in an advanced future where humanity was responsible
    for the creation of a Dyson State-of-the-art Sphere with AI support. The Earth
    has transformed into a desolate but technologically advanced game environment,
    which represents a scenario of great importance in the plot. The basic plot involves
    a tragic event in the distant future: due to a fatal mistake made by humanity
    in using the Dyson Sphere and its solar power, the human race has become extinct.
    However, AI later generated the first artificial human life form on Earth. The
    plot focuses on the tests that this new creature must face, its goal is to fully
    embody humanity. This suggests that AI is trying to restore humanity in some
    way, despite humans being long extinct.'
